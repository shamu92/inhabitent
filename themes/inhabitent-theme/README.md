I used the red academy WordPress starter theme to create the lay out of this website. The webisite was made for a fictional
company called Inhabitent camping supply co. 

I used the WordPress CMS, CSS/SASS, Jquery/JavaScript, PHP, Gulp, and Github to complete this project.

####The website includes custom fields to change the hero banner on the about page as well as the content on that page. 
#### A widgetized area was created on the side bar with the option of changing the business hours and the address.
