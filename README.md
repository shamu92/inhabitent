Using the RED academy WordPress starter theme, I created the lay out of this website. The webisite was made for a fictional
company called Inhabitent camping supply co. 

The website includes custom fields to change the hero banner on the about page as well as the content on that page. 

A widgetized area was created on the side bar with the option of changing the business hours and the address.
